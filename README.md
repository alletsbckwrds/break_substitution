# break_substitution
This is far from perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
It analyzes the most used letters and it substitutes them with the supposedly correct one.
<br/>
Inside the program itself i wrote two sets of most used letters, and commented out one of them because i thought it didn't work that well.
<br/>
Unfortunately the inside of the program is mostly written in italian since it was a school project. But i might translate it in the future.
